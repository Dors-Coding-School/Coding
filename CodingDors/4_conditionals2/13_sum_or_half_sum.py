# Title: sum_or_half_sum

"""
Write a Python function that takes two input integers 'a' and 'b', and returns their sum unless the two values are the same, in which case it should return half of their sum. For instance, if 'a' is 4 and 'b' is 5, the function should return 9. If 'a' and 'b' are both 3, the function should return 3.

sum_or_half_sum(4, 5) -> 9

sum_or_half_sum(3, 3) -> 3
